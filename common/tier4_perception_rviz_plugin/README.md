# tier4_perception_rviz_plugin

## Purpose

This plugin is used to generate dummy pedestrians, cars, and obstacles in planning simulator.

## Overview

The CarInitialPoseTool sends a topic for generating a dummy car.  
The PedestrianInitialPoseTool sends a topic for generating a dummy pedestrian.  
The UnknownInitialPoseTool sends a topic for generating a dummy obstacle.  
The DeleteAllObjectsTool deletes the dummy cars, pedestrians, and obstacles displayed by the above three tools.

## Assumptions / Known limits

Using a planning simulator

## Usage

1. Start rviz and select + on the tool tab.
   ![select_add](./images/select_add.png)
2. Select one of the following: tier4_perception_rviz_plugin and press OK.
   ![select_plugin](./images/select_plugin.png)
3. Select the new item in the tool tab (2D Dummy Car in the example) and click on it in rviz.
