# autoware_mrm_in_lane_stop_operator

## Overview

The `autoware_mrm_in_lane_stop_operator` is a ROS 2 node that implements a Minimum Risk Maneuver (MRM) operator specifically designed for in-lane stop functionality. It acts as a bridge between the **driving mode manager** and the **in-lane stop execution modules** (e.g., `in_lane_mrm_planner`).

### System Role

In the MRM decision flow:

1. **Driving Mode Manager** detects an emergency or fallback condition and issues a driving mode request for in-lane stop MRM
2. **MrmInLaneStopOperator** receives the activation request and:
   - Validates the requested mode against configured modes
   - Communicates with the relay controller to enable the in-lane stop trigger topic
   - Publishes `InLaneStopTrigger` messages to signal the in-lane stop planner to execute the maneuver with the mode's configured profile
   - Tracks MRM state transitions (UNKNOWN → NORMAL/OPERATING → SUCCEEDED)
   - Detects when the vehicle has come to a complete stop
3. **In-lane Stop Execution Modules** (e.g., `in_lane_mrm_planner`) receive the trigger and execute the controlled deceleration trajectory

### Key Characteristics

- Operates at a higher level than motion control; focuses on **mode lifecycle management** and **relay coordination**
- Relies on polling-based vehicle stop detection for robust state confirmation
- Ensures relay service availability before committing to mode activation (fail-safe behavior)
- Publishes both MRM state and per-mode `DrivingModeActive` flags for system-wide visibility

## Features

- **Flexible Driving Mode Management**: Support for multiple configurable driving modes with per-mode deceleration profiles
- **Relay Service Control**: Seamlessly switches between normal operation and MRM mode via topic relay control
- **MRM State Machine**: Tracks MRM operation state (UNKNOWN → NORMAL/OPERATING → SUCCEEDED)
- **Vehicle Stop Detection**: Polls kinematic state to detect when the vehicle has come to a complete stop
- **Driving Mode Active Flags**: Per-mode publication of `DrivingModeActive` flags for external monitoring
- **Configurable Launch Parameters**: All topic and service endpoints can be remapped via launch arguments

## Architecture

### Input/Output

#### Subscriptions

- `/localization/kinematic_state` (nav_msgs/Odometry)
  - Vehicle odometry used for stop detection (polling, not callback-based)
- `~/input/driving_mode_request` (tier4_system_msgs/DrivingModeRequest)
  - Requests to activate/deactivate driving modes
- `~/input/driving_mode_info` (tier4_system_msgs/DrivingModeInfo)
  - Current driving mode status information

#### Publishers

- `~/output/mrm_state` (tier4_system_msgs/DrivingModeMrmState)
  - MRM operation state (UNKNOWN, NORMAL, OPERATING, SUCCEEDED)
- `~/output/in_lane_stop_trigger` (tier4_system_msgs/InLaneStopTrigger)
  - Trigger signal (with deceleration profile) for the in-lane stop planner when MRM is active

- `~/input/relay_service` (tier4_system_msgs/ChangeTopicRelayControl)
  - Relay control of the topic that the MRM trajectory takes over
    (default: `/system/topic_relay_controller_pose_with_covariance/operate`)

### MRM State Machine

```text
┌─────────┐
│ UNKNOWN │  (initial state)
└────┬────┘
     │
     ├─ [mode requested inactive] → NORMAL
     │
     ├─ [mode requested active] → OPERATING
     │                  ↓
     │          [vehicle stopped] → SUCCEEDED
     │
     └─ [any error] → remains in current state
```

**State Descriptions:**

- `UNKNOWN`: Initial state before any mode request
- `NORMAL`: Mode is inactive (requested_mode_id is not set)
- `OPERATING`: Mode is active and vehicle is still moving
- `SUCCEEDED`: Mode is active and vehicle has stopped (abs(velocity) < 0.001 m/s)

### Mode Transitions

`on_request()` decides what to do based on the requested mode's deceleration **profile**, not its
mode id:

- If the requested mode is not one of the configured modes, the currently active mode (if any) is
  cancelled.
- If the requested mode resolves to the _same profile_ as the currently active mode, nothing
  happens, even if the mode id itself changed (a log message notes this case).
- If the profile differs, the node switches straight to the new mode without cancelling the
  previous one first.

### Relay Service Integration

The node communicates with a relay controller service so that the MRM trajectory can take over the
relayed topic. On mode activation:

1. Publishes the in-lane stop trigger, then calls the relay service with `relay_on=false` to stop
   the normal relay
2. Only updates the internal `active_mode_id_` if the relay service call succeeds
3. On mode deactivation, calls the relay service with `relay_on=true` to restore the normal relay

This ensures that if the relay service is unavailable, the node does not incorrectly track mode state.

`skip_relay_call` bypasses every relay service call, for bring-up and simulation where the relay
controller is not running. In that case `active_mode_id_` is updated without calling the service.

### Parameters (YAML)

**Global Parameters:**

  Each name must match the mode name registered in `driving_mode_manager`.

- `skip_relay_call` (bool): Skip all relay service calls. Set via the launch argument of the same
  name (default `false`).

**Per-Mode Parameters:**
Each mode in `mode_names` has a configuration block:

```yaml
<mode_name>:
  profile: <string> # Deceleration profile: "moderate" or "emergency" (see InLaneStopTrigger::PROFILE_*)
  send_active_flag: <bool> # Include this mode in ~/output/driving_mode_active (default: true)
```

```yaml
/**:
  ros__parameters:
    mode_names:
      - in_lane_moderate_stop
